The first map visualizes the Human Development Index (HDI) of each country, using a color gradient where red indicates a lower HDI and green signifies a higher HDI. This choice of color gradient intuitively communicates the spectrum of human development levels, with red commonly associated with danger or lower performance, and green with prosperity or higher performance.

In contrast, the second map focuses on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data. Here, we again used a red-to-green gradient, with red representing lower GDP values and green indicating higher GDPs. This consistent use of color schemes across both maps aids in maintaining coherence and ease of understanding for the viewer.
